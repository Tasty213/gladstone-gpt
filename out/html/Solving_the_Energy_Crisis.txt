Solving the Energy Crisis
Energy bills have hit record highs. People are being forced to choose between heating and eating. Businesses face closure. Schools, hospitals, and public services are being pushed into difficult choices.
Meanwhile, oil and gas companies like BP and Shell are making record profits off the back of high bills.
The Conservative’s failure to invest in renewable energy and to insulate our homes has led directly to this energy crisis.
And their cosy relationships with the oil and gas industry sees those companies let off the hook with exemptions and loopholes allowing them to avoid the windfall tax.
Under the government’s plans energy bills will be going up not down. Their budget withdrew the £400 energy grant, which was given to all households last year.
Meanwhile, they’ve cut energy support for businesses by 85%, putting at risk our pubs, restaurants, public services and farms.
Continuing as we are now isn’t an option. We have to act to solve this energy crisis for the long term.
That’s why today Liberal Democrat members have passed new policy:
Boosting renewable energy by increasing funding for wind, solar and marine power, and removing the Conservatives’ restrictions on new schemes.
Giving local authorities more power to build community renewable energy.
An emergency programme to insulate all Britain’s homes by 2030, cutting emissions and fuel bills, and ending fuel poverty.
Cutting energy bills to £1,971, the level they were last April.
Changing the structure of energy bills to decouple the price of electricity from the gas price.
Looking into a social tariff for the most vulnerable.
Building a closer relationship between the UK and EU on energy issues, including building more interconnectors, working with member states to develop a renewable energy industry and linking into the EU emissions trading scheme.
Liberal Democrat plans would cut energy bills for consumers and businesses, reduce emissions and set Britain on a path to a sustainable future.
