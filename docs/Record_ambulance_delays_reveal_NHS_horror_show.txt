Record ambulance delays reveal NHS horror show
Our NHS isn't just at breaking point - it’s splitting at its very seams.
Ambulance delays for life-threatening calls reached a new record high in December.
Thousands of excess deaths, millions on waiting lists and hours until an ambulance arrives, this is a horror show of the Government's creation. People will be petrified when they or their loved ones fall ill.
The average response time for life-threatening Category 1 calls reached almost 11 minutes, easily the highest on record and significantly above the target of 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, for Category 2 calls which can include heart attacks and strokes, average response times reached a staggering 1 hour 33 minutes, more than 50% higher than the previous record high. This is five times higher than the target for Category 2 calls of 18 minutes.
Liberal Democrats are demanding the Government release the money they promised to help discharge patients from hospitals, in the next 7 days.
