Ed Davey's Christmas Message
I love this time of year. The cards, the carols, the chocolate. And spending precious time with our family. To celebrate together, to have fun together, and to give each other presents and thanks.
And to give thanks to God. For me, the message of Christmas is for us to treat others - as we would wish to be treated. And the symbol of Christmas is light, even in the darkest week of the year, the light of hope. Hope we so desperately need in these most challenging of times.
So from my family to yours: We wish you a Christmas full of peace, joy and love. And hope. Hope for a better future.
And as we hold in our hearts those less fortunate than ourselves. Who won't share Christmas with the comfort of family. Whether because loved ones have died. Or because they've been separated by war and destruction. Let’s give them the gift of hope this Christmas too.
Happy Christmas.
