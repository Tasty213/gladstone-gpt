Make someone amazing smile - nominate them for an award!
The Liberal Democrat Party Awards recognise publicly those who have given the party outstanding service and commitment. They are presented at Federal Conference and each winner receives a trophy to keep.
The Leader’s Award
Criteria: Awarded to those who have shown exemplary leadership skills while working or volunteering for the Party. Ranging from long-standing service at the helm of a council, to effective rallying of new and exciting campaigns for our party, or even guiding a local party through a difficult time, any member is eligible and this award seeks to recognise leadership in all of its shapes and sizes.
The Bertha Bowness Fischer Award
Background: This award is named for the country’s first woman to become a qualified election agent, a trailblazer who is a testament to our traditions of equality, inclusion and campaigning rigour.
Eligibility: Any newer (less than two years) member of the party.
Criteria: Awarded to those who have shown outstanding energy and/or ingenuity in supporting their new-found political home. This award recognises the huge contributions new members can make right from the start even if they are new to politics or Liberal Democracy.
The Albert Ingham Award
Background: This award is named for one of the Party’s great Election Agents, Albert Ingham. Albert’s work, much of it in his home county of Yorkshire, was prodigious and his impact on the Party ranged from organising to fundraising to promoting fresh talent.
Eligibility: Any election agent or senior member of a campaign team.
Criteria: Awarded to those whose most recent campaign, through its excellence, fastidiousness, tenacity or novelty is a model for others to follow.
The Laura Grimond award
Background: This award is named for a woman who, as The Independent put it, was dedicated to promoting “political pluralism without seeking publicity for herself". Lady Grimond reminds us all that some of the most crucial work, by the best of us, takes place outside of the limelight.
Eligibility: This award is given to recognise and celebrate the efforts of people working for the Party at a Federal, State, Regional, or Parliamentary/Scottish Parliamentary/Senedd level. It is a sister award to the Belinda Eyre-Brook award (given at Autumn Conferences), which recognises local and community staff/campaigners.
Criteria: The winner of this award will have shown exceptional commitment to their duties within the Party, going above and beyond to advance our cause. This award particularly aims to recognise the unsung work which enables our front-line campaigns to steal the show.
