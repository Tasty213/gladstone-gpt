Celebrating the lives of incredible women
Today is International Women’s Day - a chance to celebrate women, honour their achievements, and reflect on where we still need to go.
Our country has taken many important steps towards achieving gender equality - and I’m proud of the role Liberal Democrats have played in delivering that progress. Although we have come so far, it’s clear there is still much more to do to achieve true equality.
And to make that happen, we need as many brilliant women as possible making an impact at all levels of government - making decisions, sharing their concerns, and helping set the political agenda.
I’m proud that for the first time ever, women make up the majority of our party in the House of Commons. In no small part, this is thanks to the incredible work of our Campaign for Gender Balance and the transformative impact of all-women shortlists.
And our women MPs are doing fantastic work. Like Christine Jardine’s campaign to get social media companies to take online abuse seriously, which you can read more about here. Or Wera Hobhouse’s Bill to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, which is making its way through Parliament right now.
So this International Women’s Day, I will be celebrating so many incredible women - who have brought us this far; who work tirelessly for equality; and who will take us even further in the years to come.
