Lib Dems win in local elections
Liberal Democrats won right across the country in May's local elections with successes from the Scottish Highlands to Somerset, from Kingston-Upon-Thames to Kingston-Upon-Hull, from Powys to St Albans.
Liberal Democrats elected 868 Councillors, a net gain of 224!
We are winning again because we are listening to people. Because we hear their concerns and their frustration. Because we are standing up for our values, standing up for our communities, and fighting for a fair deal.
The great British people deserve so much better than this law-breaking Prime Minister and his out-of-touch Conservative Government.
