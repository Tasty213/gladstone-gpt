Stepping up support for Kinship Carers
Each year, thousands of grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings and family friends step up to support a child who is unable to live with their birth parents. They deserve more support.
Yesterday, I introduced the Kinship Care Bill in the House of Commons. This bill calls on the Government to provide all friends and relatives who look after a child who cannot live with their birth parents with an allowance of at least £137 a week: the same level as for foster carers.
Each year, thousands step up to support a child who is unable to live with their birth parents. They turn their lives upside down to provide a child with a loving, stable home, when the alternative is often local authority care.
"Government policy treats kinship carers as a Cinderella service"
This often comes at a huge personal and financial sacrifice. Many give up their careers or pension savings. They are left to face the challenge of looking after a child who may well have suffered abuse or neglect.
As the cost-of-living crisis bites, kinship carers should not have to choose between paying the bills and looking after a loved one.
The cost of living is hitting kinship carers hard. A survey by charity Kinship revealed:
44% of carers surveyed said that they could not pay all their household bills;
18% could not keep up with rent or mortgage payments;
26% could not afford food for their families.
Every child that goes into kinship care instead of local authority care could save the taxpayer more than £35,000 a year. Yet Government policy treats kinship carers as a Cinderella service, denying most of them the support received by foster carers or adoptive parents.
I’ve just introduced the Kinship Care Bill in Parliament. Thousands of friends & relatives turn their lives upside down, often overnight, to look after a child in crisis. My Bill would give them the financial & practical support they desperately need #StepUpForKinshipCarers ¦ pic.twitter.com/B9XG1fE7v3
