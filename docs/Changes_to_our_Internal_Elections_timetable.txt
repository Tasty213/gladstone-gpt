Changes to our Internal Elections timetable
Given the tragic news of Her Majesty the Queen's death, the Returning Officer has decided to alter the planned timetable for our Internal Elections.
The original timetable was based on the idea that it would enable candidates to collect nominations as part of the planned Conference in Brighton. Now that this has been cancelled, we are faced with both an increased workload for the staff team, as well as there being no conference at which to collect nominations.
Consequently, the Returning Officer has decided to delay the opening of nominations by 1 week, to the 20th September at 5pm.
In addition, the period in which candidates can collect nominations has been extended by 1 week.
Candidates now have until 6pm on Monday 10th October to collect the necessary nominations for roles they wish to stand for.
