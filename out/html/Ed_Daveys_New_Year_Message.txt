Ed Davey's New Year Message
Those Jubilee street parties which brought communities together after so long kept apart by Covid. The Lionesses bringing football home at Wembley, and the men's team on that brilliant run in the World Cup too. And another fantastic by-election for the Liberal Democrats!
But it was a very difficult year too:
Vladimir Putin's appalling war that has claimed the lives of thousands of brave Ukrainians. The political chaos in the Conservative party, that has wreaked economic chaos on the rest of us. And, of course, the very sad passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. The end of a truly magnificent reign.
The New Year is an opportunity to turn the page and look ahead. And although things are tough for millions, I sense change is possible this year - so I look to the New Year with optimism and with hope.
And of course we have a joyful and historic occasion later this year with the coronation of King Charles III. Another chance for communities to come together and celebrate together.
So I'd like to wish you and your family a very Happy New Year. Let’s hope it’s a chance for a fresh start in so many ways.
