At its meeting on 6 June, the Committee considered the audit findings report on the 2022 Federal Party accounts from UHY Hacker Young.
The Committee also progressed its plans for an internal audit, and scheduled a review of legacy donations for September.
May 2023
After our inaugural meeting in late March, FASC got down to business in this month's meeting.
We considered progress on the annual audit, with a report from the Financial Controller. We then reviewed the Risk Register with the Chief Executive, Mike Dixon. The Risk Register is an integral part of the Federal Party's management systems. It is maintained by the Chief Executive personally, and regularly discussed with the management team.
We also considered how to give the Party additional assurance on the health of internal controls, and are planning an internal audit. This would be a regular feature of FASC's activities.
