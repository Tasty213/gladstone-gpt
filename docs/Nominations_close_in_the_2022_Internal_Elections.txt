*These roles elect more than 10 members, so the diversity rules set out in article 2.6 of the constitution. For all other committee roles, article 2.5 applies. Those articles are reproduced below and can also be found here.
2.5 Whenever this Constitution provides for the election by party members to a Federal Committee, not less than 40% or, if 40% is not a whole number, the whole number nearest to but not exceeding 40% of those elected shall self-identify as men or non-binary people, and self-identify as women or non-binary people respectively.
2.6 Whenever this Constitution provides for the election by party members of ten or more persons to any Federal Committee or other Federal body: A. not less than 10% or, if 10% is not a whole number, the whole number nearest to but not exceeding 10% shall be from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds; B.

** For Elections to the ALDE Delegation Articles 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 of the Federal Constitution do not apply, per article 55 of the Election Rules. Instead one place is reserved for a member from each state party and one person under 26. The article is reproduced below and can also be found here.
55. Following the resolution of the federal conference, the regulations set out in paragraphs 2–25 and 45–53 shall apply to elections for the Liberal Democrat members of the Council of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) with the following exceptions:
The requirements for the elections of the minimum proportions of candidates with protected characteristics in Articles 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 of the constitution are replaced by the requirement that those elected shall include a minimum of one person from each state party and one person under the age of 26 at the time of the election.
