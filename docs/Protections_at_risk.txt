The Conservative Government’s new Retained EU Law Bill aims to remove hundreds of pieces of legislation from UK law.
This is short-sighted politics at its worst, putting political posturing above all else.
Protections at risk
Protections for parents
The Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999 underpin all parental leave allowances in the UK.
Protections for workers
The Part-time Workers Regulation 2000 prevent part-time and fixed-term workers from being treated less favourably than others.
Protections for our NHS
The European Qualifications (Health and Social Care) Regulations 2019 allow the British organisations such as the NHS to recognise the European qualifications of doctors, nurses and other health and social care workers.
Protections for children
The Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts by Children) Regulations 1993 protect children from serious injury or death in vehicle accidents.
Protections for artists
The Artists Resale Rights Regulations 2011 entitles the artist to a royalty when their copyrighted work is resold.
Proections for travellers
Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 on Flight Compensation requires compensation and assistance to passengers if denied boarding, flight cancellation or long delay to flights.
The Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 give legal and financial protection to consumers in case of cancellation or if company becomes insolvent.
Protections for animals
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 make it a criminal offence to damage habitats of key species.
Liberal Democrat Peers have tabled amendments to the Bill to ensure these regulations are immune from being discarded.
This means that Government Ministers will be forced to treat these regulations separately, with a new debate about whether they should be retained later this month before the remainder of the Bill can be discussed - holding up proceedings to ensure that child safety, travel compensation and workers rights are protected.
Liberal Democrats are demanding that the Government puts the needs of real people before their ideological obsessions. Risking these regulations is reckless and irresponsible.
